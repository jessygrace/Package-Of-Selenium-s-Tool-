<h3><u><strong>Seleniums Tool Package</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium Training Online&nbsp;is composed of multiple applications applications. Each has a unique role.</p>

<p>Selenium 2 (aka. Selenium WebDriver)<br />
Selenium 2 is the future direction of the project and the latest addition to the Selenium Training tool-Kit. This brand-new automation tool supplies a wide range of wonderful features, including a more cohesive and object oriented API together with an response to the limits of the old execution.</p>

<p>As you may read in Brief History of The Selenium Webdriver Training Task, the Selenium and WebDriver developers agreed that both tools have edges and that blending the two jobs would make a more strong automation tool.</p>

<p>Selenium 2.0 is the product of that attempt. It supports the WebDriver API and underlying technology, together with the Selenium 1 technology beneath the the WebDriver API for optimum flexibility in porting your tests. Moreover, Selenium 2 nonetheless runs Selenium 1s Selenium RC interface for backwards-compatibility.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Selenium-WebDriver</strong></u></h3>

<p><strong>Selenium-WebDriver supports the following browsers as well as the OS these browsers are compatible with:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Google Chrome</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - 3 2 and 64 bit where applicable</li>
	<li>Firefox: newest ESR, preceding ESR, current release, one preceding release</li>
	<li>Safari</li>
	<li>Opera</li>
	<li>HtmlUnit</li>
	<li>phantomjs</li>
	<li>Android (with Selendroid or appium)</li>
	<li>iOS (with ios-driver or appium)</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong>Selenium 1 (aka. Selenium RC or Remote Control)</strong></h3>

<p>As you can read in Brief Background of The Selenium Webdriver Training Online&nbsp;Project, Selenium RC was the main Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online&nbsp;project for quite a long time, before the WebDriver/Selenium unite brought up Selenium Webdriver Training, the hottest and <a href="http://seleniumdownload.com/download-selenium-windows-7-chrome/" target="_blank">more powerful instrument</a>.Now Selenium Webdriver Tutorial is deprecated and is not actively supported (mainly in maintenance mode).</p>

<h3><u><strong>Selenium IDE</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a prototyping software for building test scripts. It&#39;s a Firefox plugin and offers an easy-to-use interface for developing automated tests. Selenium IDE has a recording feature, which records user actions as they may be performed and then exports them as a re-usable script in one of several programming languages that may be later executed.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Notice</strong></u></h3>

<p>Even though Selenium IDE has a Save feature that allows users to keep the evaluations in a table-based format for later import and execution, it&#39;s not made to to perform your test passes nor could it be designed to construct all the automatic tests you will need. Especially, Selenium IDE doesnt provide iteration or conditional statements for check scripts. During the time of writing there isn&#39;t any plan to add such point. The grounds are partly technical and partly according to the Selenium Webdriver Training Online developers supporting best methods in test automation which always demands some quantity of programming. Selenium IDE is only intended as a rapid prototyping device. The Selenium Webdriver Tutorial Online developers urge for significant, strong test automation either Selenium 2 or Selenium 1 to be combined with among the many supported programming languages.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Selenium-Grid</strong></u></h3>

<p>Selenium-Grid allows the Selenium RC alternative to scale for large test suites and for test suites that has to be run in multiple environments. Selenium Grid enables one to run your tests in parallel, that&#39;s, distinct tests could be run at the same time on various remote machines. It&#39;s two advantages. First, for those who possess a big test suite, or a slow-running test suite, you can boost its performance greatly by using Selenium Grid to break up your test-suite to run different tests at once using those different machines. Also, in case you need to run your test suite on multiple surroundings you&#39;ll have distinct remote machines supporting and running your evaluations in them at precisely the same time. In each case Selenium Grid greatly improves the time it takes to run your suite by taking advantage of parallel processing.</p>
